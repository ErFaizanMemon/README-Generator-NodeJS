# Weather Forecast using Server Side APIs

## Description

As a big traveler myself I wanted to have an efficient and handy tool that allowed me to know the forecast of weather of any city for the next upcoming five days. I travel frequently and also find myself in need of future weather information. I found existing solutions to be bloated with features I didn't need, so I decided to create my own.

## Installation

Build the node modules first running this command: "npm i" and then start the script using node with the command: "node index"

## Usage

1. On the webpage you'll see the main heading "Weather Forecast" at the top of the page. Below that, there's an input field below the label "City:" and a "Search" button.
2. Enter the name of the city you want to check the weather for in the input field.
3. On clicking the "Search" button the webpage will fetch the weather data for the city you entered from the Server API Openweather and display the 5-day forecast below with temperature, humidity, and wind speed details.
4. To check the weather for another city, simply repeat steps 1-3.
5. Search History is saved under local storage.
